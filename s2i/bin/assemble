# Need to make everything group writable so that 'oc rsync' will work

# writable by the owner writable by the group, but this is the only way
# to make it work when running container as an arbitrary user ID and
# relying on group access controls.
#
# Note that this will fail to change the permissions of the /app
# directory itself. We therefore suppress any warnings, but we also need
# to ignore the exit status as any failure will cause an error exit
# status even though permissions of remaining files are updated as we
