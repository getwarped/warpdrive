# This is the script that prepares the Python application to be run. It
# would normally be triggered from a derived docker image explicitly,
# as a deferred ONBUILD action, or from an S2I builder.
#
# The main purpose of the script is to run 'pip install' on any user
# supplied 'requirements.txt' file. In addition to that though, it will
# also run any user provided scripts for performing actions before or
# after the installation of any application dependencies. These user
# scripts enable the ability to install additional system packages, or
# run any application specific startup commands for preparing an
# application, such as for running 'collectstatic' on a Django web
# application.

# Ensure that any failure within this script or a user provided script
# causes this script to fail immediately. This eliminates the need to
# check individual statuses for anything which is run and prematurely
# exit. Note that the feature of bash to exit in this way isn't
# foolproof. Ensure that you heed any advice in:
#
#   http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
#   http://fvue.nl/wiki/Bash:_Error_handling
#
# and use best practices to ensure that failures are always detected.
# Any user supplied scripts should also use this failure mode.
